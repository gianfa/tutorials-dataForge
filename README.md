## Data-Forge useful code
Just some examples of use of [data-forge](https://github.com/data-forge/data-forge-ts/blob/master/docs/guide.md), a pandas/LINQ inspired nodejs module, from Ashley Davis.  

Data-Forge also comprises many other libraries useful to perform data anaylsis.
In this section you can find a cheet sheet resulting from my work notes. Hope it can be helpful to somebody :).
