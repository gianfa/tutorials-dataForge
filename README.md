  # A gentle introduction to data-forge dataFrames
 As the title says, this is just a very smooth introduction to dataForge dataframe in JS.
 [DataForge](https://github.com/data-forge/data-forge-ts) is a wonderful library by Ashley Davis.
 Here the very basics are presented, in order to make you able to start using it and step by step become
 autonomous.
 The structure of this introduction follows a targets path, instead of a skill/path. I think this will be more
 easy to follow. Here it is.
  1. Your first dataFrame [creation, basic operations]
  2. What if we want to know how many single people are there? [filtering]
  3. What if we want to know how much is the average single admins balance? [more filtering, calculations]

 ## 1. Create a new DataFrame
 Creating a dataframe is very easy. Let's take an excerpt of the famous [Bank Marketing Data Set](https:archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing)
 and put it in our first dataframe.
```javascript
const dataForge = require('data-forge'); // first of all require it

let df = new dataForge.DataFrame({
    columnNames: ["age","job","marital","education","default","balance","housing","loan","contact","day","month","duration","campaign","pdays","previous","poutcome","y"],
    rows: [
        [58,"management","married","tertiary","no",2143,"yes","no","unknown",5,"may",261,1,-1,0,"unknown","no"],
        [44,"technician","single","secondary","no",29,"yes","no","unknown",5,"may",151,1,-1,0,"unknown","no"],
        [33,"entrepreneur","married","secondary","no",2,"yes","yes","unknown",5,"may",76,1,-1,0,"unknown","no"],
        [47,"blue-collar","married","unknown","no",1506,"yes","no","unknown",5,"may",92,1,-1,0,"unknown","no"],
        [33,"unknown","single","unknown","no",1,"no","no","unknown",5,"may",198,1,-1,0,"unknown","no"],
        [35,"management","married","tertiary","no",231,"yes","no","unknown",5,"may",139,1,-1,0,"unknown","no"],
        [28,"management","single","tertiary","no",447,"yes","yes","unknown",5,"may",217,1,-1,0,"unknown","no"],
        [42,"entrepreneur","divorced","tertiary","yes",2,"yes","no","unknown",5,"may",380,1,-1,0,"unknown","no"],
        [58,"retired","married","primary","no",121,"yes","no","unknown",5,"may",50,1,-1,0,"unknown","no"],
        [43,"technician","single","secondary","no",593,"yes","no","unknown",5,"may",55,1,-1,0,"unknown","no"],
        [41,"admin.","divorced","secondary","no",270,"yes","no","unknown",5,"may",222,1,-1,0,"unknown","no"],
        [29,"admin.","single","secondary","no",390,"yes","no","unknown",5,"may",137,1,-1,0,"unknown","no"],
        [53,"technician","married","secondary","no",6,"yes","no","unknown",5,"may",517,1,-1,0,"unknown","no"],
        [58,"technician","married","unknown","no",71,"yes","no","unknown",5,"may",71,1,-1,0,"unknown","no"],
        [57,"services","married","secondary","no",162,"yes","no","unknown",5,"may",174,1,-1,0,"unknown","no"],
        [51,"retired","married","primary","no",229,"yes","no","unknown",5,"may",353,1,-1,0,"unknown","no"],
        [45,"admin.","single","unknown","no",13,"yes","no","unknown",5,"may",98,1,-1,0,"unknown","no"],
        [57,"blue-collar","married","primary","no",52,"yes","no","unknown",5,"may",38,1,-1,0,"unknown","no"],
        [60,"retired","married","primary","no",60,"yes","no","unknown",5,"may",219,1,-1,0,"unknown","no"],
        [33,"services","married","secondary","no",0,"yes","no","unknown",5,"may",54,1,-1,0,"unknown","no"],
        [28,"blue-collar","married","secondary","no",723,"yes","yes","unknown",5,"may",262,1,-1,0,"unknown","no"],
        [56,"management","married","tertiary","no",779,"yes","no","unknown",5,"may",164,1,-1,0,"unknown","no"],
        [32,"blue-collar","single","primary","no",23,"yes","yes","unknown",5,"may",160,1,-1,0,"unknown","no"],
        [25,"services","married","secondary","no",50,"yes","no","unknown",5,"may",342,1,-1,0,"unknown","no"],
        [40,"retired","married","primary","no",0,"yes","yes","unknown",5,"may",181,1,-1,0,"unknown","no"],
        [44,"admin.","married","secondary","no",-372,"yes","no","unknown",5,"may",172,1,-1,0,"unknown","no"],
    ],
});
console.log(df.toString());
```

 ### Drop a column
 It seems some columns have "unknown" value in every records, better to [drop](https://github.com/data-forge/data-forge-ts/blob/master/docs/guide.md#removing-columns) them.
```javascript
df = df.dropSeries(["contact", "poutcome"]);
console.log(df.toString());
```

 ## 2. What if we want to know how many single people are there?

 ### Counting records
 First of all let's [count](https://github.com/data-forge/data-forge-ts/blob/master/docs/guide.md#aggregate) the number of people in this dataset.
 Nowing that the number of people is equal to the number of rows it is quite easy.
```javascript
const nPeople = df.count();
console.log(`There are ${nPeople} people in this dataset`);
```

 ### Filter records
 Who are the singles in here?
 It's just about to ask "Gimme all the rows, [WHERE](https://github.com/data-forge/data-forge-ts/blob/master/docs/guide.md#filtering) each row.marital is 'single' ".
```javascript
const df_singles = df.where( row => row.marital === 'single');
console.log(`Here come the unmarried ones!\n${df_singles.toString()}`);
```

 ### Counting on filtered rows
 Now we can answer to the starting question
```javascript
const nSingles = df_singles.count();
console.log(`There are ${nSingles} singles inside this dataset`);
```

 We can even count the percentage of the along the entire dataset
```javascript
console.log(`...and they are ${parseInt(100*nSingles/nPeople)}% of this dataset`);
```

 If we don't want to spread variables around we can do all in one [chain](https://github.com/data-forge/data-forge-ts/blob/master/docs/guide.md#immutability-and-chained-functions).
```javascript
nPeople_chained = df.where( row => row.marital === 'single').count();
```

 ## 3. What if we want to know how much is the average single admins balance?
 We now have a double condition to check, let's see how.

 ### Filter records, multiple condition
```javascript
const df_singles_admin = df.where( row => row.marital === 'single' && row.job === 'admin.' );
console.log(`Introducing you the single administrative employees\n${df_singles_admin.toString()}`);
```

 ### Take a field
 In order to compute the average of the balance, we need to extract that column.
 This is possible getting it as a Series, by [_getSeries_](https://github.com/data-forge/data-forge-ts/blob/master/docs/guide.md#extracting-columns-and-series-from-a-dataframe) .
```javascript
const df_singles_admin_balance = df_singles_admin.getSeries('balance');
console.log(`... this is their balance\n${df_singles_admin_balance.toString()}`);
```

 ### Summing along a column
 Now [sum](https://data-forge.github.io/data-forge-ts/classes/series.html#sum) all column values.
```javascript
const singlesAdminsTotPay = df_singles_admin_balance.sum();
console.log(`... having a total equal to \n${singlesAdminsTotPay}`);
```

 ### Averaging a column
```javascript
console.log(`... so the average balance is \n${(singlesAdminsTotPay/df_singles_admin.count())}`);
```

 You have many ways to do it, in facts.
 There is a very easy dedicated function [_average_](https://data-forge.github.io/data-forge-ts/classes/series.html#average).
```javascript
console.log(`... still the balance is \n${(df_singles_admin_balance.average())}`);
```
 And if you prefer not spreading around variables, you can chain as before.
```javascript
const singlesAdminsTotPay_chained = df
  .where( row => row.marital === 'single' && row.job === 'admin.' )
  .getSeries('balance')
  .average();
console.log(`... I told you \n${(singlesAdminsTotPay_chained)} was the average balance for single admins in here`);
```

## Data-Forge useful code
In this repo also you can find cheatsheet.js, just some examples of use of [data-forge](https://github.com/data-forge/data-forge-ts/blob/master/docs/guide.md), a pandas/LINQ inspired nodejs module, from Ashley Davis.  

Data-Forge also comprises many other libraries useful to perform data anaylsis.
In this section you can find a cheet sheet resulting from my work notes. Hope it can be helpful to somebody :).

NOTES:
   ‚ùó CAVEAT: using withIndex associated with transformSeries is very dangerous!! It seems failing the referencing
