// ### Drop a column
// It seems some columns have "unknown" value in every records, better to drop them.
df = df.dropSeries(["contact", "poutcome"]);
console.log(df.toString());

// ## What if we want to know how many single people are there?

// ### Counting records
// First of all let's count the number of people in this dataset.
// Nowing that the number of people is equal to the number of rows it is quite easy.
const nPeople = df.count();
console.log(`There are ${nPeople} people in this dataset`);

// ### Filter records
// Who are the singles in here?
// It's just about to ask "Gimme all the rows, WHERE each row.marital is 'single' ".
const df_singles = df.where( row => row.marital === 'single');
console.log(`Here come the unmarried ones!\n${df_singles.toString()}`);

// ### Counting on filtered rows
// Now we can answer to the starting question
const nSingles = df_singles.count();
console.log(`There are ${nSingles} singles inside this dataset`);

// We can even conut the percentage of the along the entire dataset
console.log(`...and they are ${parseInt(100*nSingles/nPeople)}% of this dataset`);

// If we don't want to spread variables around we can do all in one chain.
nPeople_chained = df.where( row => row.marital === 'single').count();

// ## What if we want to know how much is the average single admins balance?
// We now have a double condition to check, let's see how.

// ### Filter records, multiple condition
const df_singles_admin = df.where( row => row.marital === 'single' && row.job === 'admin.' );
console.log(`Introducing you the single administrative employees\n${df_singles_admin.toString()}`);

// ### Take a field
// In order to compute the average of the balance, we need to extract that column
// This is possible getting it as a Series, by _getSeries_ .
const df_singles_admin_balance = df_singles_admin.getSeries('balance');
console.log(`... this is their balance\n${df_singles_admin_balance.toString()}`);

// ### Summing along a column
const singlesAdminsTotPay = df_singles_admin_balance.sum();
console.log(`... having a total equal to \n${singlesAdminsTotPay}`);

// ### Averaging a column
console.log(`... so the average balance is \n${(singlesAdminsTotPay/df_singles_admin.count())}`);
// You have many ways to do it, in facts.
// There is a very easy dedicated function average().
console.log(`... still the balance is \n${(df_singles_admin_balance.average())}`);
// And if you prefer not spreading around variables, you can chain as before.
let singlesAdminsTotPay_chained = df.where( row => row.marital === 'single' && row.job === 'admin.' ).getSeries('balance').average();
console.log(`... I told you ${singlesAdminsTotPay_chained} was the average balance for single admins in here`);
